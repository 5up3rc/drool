.TP
\fB\-c\fR [\fItype\fR:]\fIconfig\fR
Specify the configuration to use, if no \fItype\fR is given then
\fIconfig\fR expects to be a file. Valid types are \fBfile\fR and \fBtext\fR.
Can be given multiple times and will be processed in the
given order. See drool.conf(5) for configuration syntax.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIfacility\fR[:\fIlevel\fR]
Enable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be given
to enable just that. Can be given multiple times and will be
processed in the given order. See LOGGING for more information.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fIfacility\fR[:\fIlevel\fR]
Disable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be
given to disable just that. Can be given multiple times and
will be processed in the given order. See LOGGING for more information.

\fB\-f\fR \fIfilter\fR
Set the Berkeley Packet Filter to use.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinterface\fR
Capture packets from interface, can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIfile.pcap\fR

\fB\-R\fR \fImode\fR
Specify the mode for reading PCAP files, see READ MODES for
available modes.

\fBdrool\fR will exit once processing of PCAP files is complete or if
interrupted (CTRL-C or SIGINT). If any interface is being processed or
if loop read mode is being used, then \fBdrool\fR must be interruped in
order to exit.

\fBdrool\fR can be forcefully exited by interrupting (CTRL-C or SIGINT) twice.
