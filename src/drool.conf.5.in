.TH drool.conf 5 "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "DNS Replay Tool Configuration"
.SH NAME
drool.conf \- Configuration for DNS Replay Tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
With these configuration options for \fIdrool\fR you can control all
aspects of generating/replaying DNS traffic. Some options are also
available as command line options.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.TP
\fBlog\fR FACILITY [ LEVEL ] ;
Enable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be given
to enable just that. Can be given multiple times and will be
processed in the given order. See LOGGING for more information.
.TP
\fBnolog\fR FACILITY [ LEVEL ] ;
Disable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be
given to disable just that. Can be given multiple times and
will be processed in the given order. See LOGGING for more information.
.TP
\fBread\fR " FILE " ;
Read packets from PCAP file, can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fBinput\fR " INTERFACE " ;
Capture packets from interface, can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fBfilter\fR " FILTER " ;
Set the Berkeley Packet Filter to use.
.TP
\fBtiming\fR ignore ;
Set the timing mode to ignore all timings and try to send traffic as fast
as possible.
.TP
\fBtiming\fR keep ;
Set the timing mode to try and keep up with interval between the traffic
received, will give a warning if it can't keep up sending it out at the
same rate.
.TP
\fBtiming\fR add NANOSECONDS ;
Set the timing mode to add the given nanoseconds to the interval between
the traffic received.
.TP
\fBtiming\fR reduce NANOSECONDS ;
Set the timing mode to reduce the interval between the traffic received
with the given nano seconds, will give a warning if it can't keep up
sending it out at the new rate.
.TP
\fBtiming\fR multiply MULTIPLY_AS_FLOAT ;
Set the timing mode to multiply the interval between the traffic received,
this can be thought as percent with 1.00 being 100% of the interval, 2.00
being 200%, 0.10 being 10% and so on. Will give a warning if it can't keep
up sending it out at the new rate.
.TP
\fBcontext\fR client_pools NUMBER ;
Set the number of client pools to use per context (a context is a \fIread\fR
or \fIinterface\fR), default is one.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR target " IP_OR_HOSTNAME " " SERVICE_OR_PORT ";
Set the target of the client pools, where to send the traffic.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR max_clients NUMBER ;
Set the maximum clients each client pool can have.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR client_ttl SECONDS_AS_FLOAT ;
Set the time a client lives for, this is used to timeout clients in case
the target does not answer. Specified as a float meaning 0.05 would be 50
milliseconds.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR skip_reply ;
Enables a mode where replies are ignored and client is considered successful
after just sending.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR max_reuse_clients NUMBER ;
Set the maximum clients to save for reuse, this only applies to protocol that
can be reused.
.TP
\fBclient_pool\fR sendas < original | udp | tcp > ;
Set how to send the traffic, default is original which sends the traffic with
the same protocol it was received with.

.SH LOGGING
Logging is enabled and disabled in the order specified in the configuration
which allows for enabling of all logging and disabling of specific, for
example:

  log all;
  nolog network debug;

The following logging facilities exists:
.TP
\fBcore\fR
Log messages about initializing, configuration and start up.
.TP
\fBnetwork\fR
Log messages about network related tasks.
.TP
\fBall\fR
Log messages for all facilities, this is only used to configure logging.
.LP
The following logging level exists for all facilities:
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Log messages about the very inner workings, use with caution since it
generates a lot of messages.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR
Log messages of the informational kind that may not be interesting in normal
operation.
.TP
\fBnotice\fR
Log messages of the informational kind that may be interesting in normal
operation.
.TP
\fBwarning\fR
Log message of the warning kind that indicates possible disruption in
operation.
.TP
\fBerror\fR
Log messages of the error kind that will most likely result in termination
of operation.
.TP
\fBcritical\fR
Log messages of the critical kind that indicates termination of operation.
.TP
\fBall\fR
Log messages for all levels, this is only used to configure logging.
