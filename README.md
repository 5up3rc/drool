# DNS Replay Tool (drool)

`drool` can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send
it to a specified server, with options such as to manipulate the timing
between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number
of iterations. This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount
of UDP packets per second and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
on the DNS and measure normal DNS querying. For example, the tool could
enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be able to replay it later
to test if new code or hardening techniques are useful, safe & effective.
Another example is to be able to replay a packet stream for a
bug that is sequence- and/or timing-related in order to validate the
efficacy of subsequent bug fixes.

## Usage example

This example reads all DNS queries from a PCAP file, sends them to
a nameserver at `127.0.0.1` and ignores both timings and replies.

```
drool \
  -vv \
  -c 'text:timing ignore;' \
  -c 'text:client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53";' \
  -c 'text:client_pool skip_reply;' \
  -r file.pcap
```
